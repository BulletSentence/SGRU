# SGRU (Sistema de Gerenciamento do Restaurante Universit√°rio)
## Sistema Gerenciador de Tickets em JAVA.


* This work aims to optimize management control restaurant, generate better efficiency and lower costs for the institution, as well as decrease the amount of food wasted during meals. Cost reduction is directly linked to the consolidation of a system for assessing the number of people who ordered a meal that day. These data will be the basis for the amount of food produced in the day, avoiding waste due to production in an amount corresponding to the demand.

* The advantages of this system go beyond the reduction of waste because you can also use the results and reports to optimize the entire process chain and food campus distribution, how to know the busiest days, when it will be necessary to produce more or less power , in addition to reducing the time for ordering tickets for the university restaurant.

* Based on this proposal, communication between the restaurant and the management must be carried out entirely by the system using an Internet connection, eliminating the need to deliver reports in person and also improving the fidelity and reliability of the samples, since the process will be entirely carried out processed and validated by the system itself.

* Currently, IFMA-Campus Caxias has approximately 2,000 students enrolled and more than 100 civil servants, who attend the campus in the morning, afternoon and evening shifts, which requires the daily production of breakfast, lunch and dinner. In addition, IFMA-Campus Caxias has accommodation for resident students, who receive food in three shifts throughout the school year.

* As a result, there is a great demand for food requests on a daily basis, which varies according to the performance of campus activities. Currently, all of these requests are processed manually, which leads to inefficiency, slowness and errors. Therefore, the development of the system proposed in this research will contribute significantly to improve and optimize the entire food requisition and production chain at IFMA-Campus Caxias.
